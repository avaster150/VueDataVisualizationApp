# Vue Data Visualization App

The application displays random user data using the Randomuser API. The app includes pagination to display different user pages by triggering new API calls. Also there is a button to sort users by their age, which is a control to interact with the data on the screen. In addition, functionality has been implemented to add users to the 'Favorites' list, which is displayed in a separate view using Vue Router.
